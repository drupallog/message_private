INTRODUCTION
------------
A message type and entity reference fields, enabling sending and receiving 
private messages using The Message Stack. Messages of type "Private Message" can 
be sent by creating the private_message message instance with fields referencing 
user entities or OG group entities using the submodule message_private_og.

The message_private module includes the following.
+ A message type "Private Message" with entity reference field referencing users
+ A message view, message_private for "User Messages"

The sub-module message_private_og includes the following.
+ An entity reference field for groups to associate messages to groups
+ A "Group Messages" display for the message_private view


DEPENDENCIES
------------
The message_private module requires the following modules:
 * Message (https://drupal.org/project/message)
 * Message UI (https://drupal.org/project/message_ui)
 * Message Notify (https://drupal.org/project/message_notify)
 * Entity API (https://www.drupal.org/project/entity)
 * Entity Reference (https://www.drupal.org/project/entityreference)
 * Ctools (https://www.drupal.org/project/ctools)
 * Views (https://www.drupal.org/project/views)
 * Token (https://www.drupal.org/project/token

The message_private_og module requires the following modules:
 * OG (https://drupal.org/project/og)


INSTALLATION
------------
 * Install as you would normally install a contributed drupal module. See:
   https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7
   for further information.
 * If using message_private_og, make sure you have created an OG group content
   type named "Group". Otherwise, you will need to manually configure the entity 
   reference field to use your custom group content type.


CONFIGURATION
-------------
Enable the permissions: 
"View a new message instance for Private Message" &
"Create a new message instance for Private Message" for users needing to create
and view private messages.
"View user profiles" for users needing to send messages to other users. This is
due to issue: 'Restricted access results with user entityreference' - #2153463.

The module has no menu or modifiable settings.  There is not much
configuration.  When enabled, the module will provide a new message type
"Private Message" and a Message Private View.

Email notifications are sent using message_notify module to users referenced by 
the field_message_user_ref field and for all group members of the groups 
referenced by field_message_groups_ref if using message_private_og. Users can
disable email notifications using the checkbox field 
field_private_message_notify attached to the user entity, on their profile.

When using the Message Private OG sub-module, the Group Messages display has
a contextual filter which filters by group ID of the logged in user. This is
developed taking into account that a content type called "Group" exists for all
Group instances. Anything other than this setup requires user customisation. You
must manually set the field_message_groups_ref contextual filter to use group
bundle to enable group filter on views.

HOW TO USE
----------
To create messages:
Visit /admin/content/message/create/private-message and Save the message to send

For received messages:
Visit your user page at /user and find the "Inbox" tab which displays received
messages /user/USER_ID/messages/inbox

For sent messages:
Visit your user page at /user and find the "Sent" tab which displays sent
messages /user/USER_ID/messages/sent

For group messages:
Visit your user page at /user and find the "Group" tab which displays group
messages /user/USER_ID/messages/group

SECURITY
--------
This module does not come with any security features out-of-the-box, but you can
easily configure your own using methods and modules of you choice.

Examples:

Honeypot and timestamp methods: https://www.drupal.org/project/honeypot
CAPTCHA method: https://www.drupal.org/project/recaptcha


DEVELOPMENT AND TEST
------------------
 * Message should not be created without a user or group.
 * Add to admin screen the option to turn on or off email notifications.
 * Create og permissions and permission checking for private messages.
 * Create global message_private_og permission - sending message to all groups.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Work above required before releasing 1st beta release.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Threads can be created using entity reference field on a private message, 
   which reference the message being replied to. A new permission to reply to 
   messages can be created if necessary. An admin screen can be used to enable 
   or disable threads to turn on/off replies on all private messages (Reply, 
   Reply All). A tpl.php template and perhaps a css file will need to be added 
   for indentation / presentation.
 * Flag module on user entity to block/unblock users from messaging them
 * Flag module on message entity to show/hide messages from users own display
 * Integrate with rolereference module or similar to provide sending to users
   within a certain role.
 * Research the benefits of Rules module integration and what could be provided.
 * Tests should be created in a "tests" folder.
